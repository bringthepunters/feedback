<p>
<img alt="" class="inline-block w-8 h-8 mr-3 align-middle" src="Whatsnext/images/image12.png"/>
        Take a moment to <span class="font-bold">reflect</span> on these additional questions to gain deeper insights on different feedback scenarios:
      </p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
<li>What is your default Feedback Animal when you are <span class="font-bold">under pressure</span>? Is it different to your preferred style? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What Feedback Animal would you like to  <span class="font-bold">be a little more like</span>? How is it different to your current usual style? </li>
<li>What situations or scenarios might best suit giving feedback like the owl/lorikeet/meerkat/lioness?</li>
<li>Are there other Feedback Animal cards that you relate to? Which is your <span class="font-bold">secondary archetype</span> for giving feedback?</li>
<li>Which feedback animals have you experienced as a receiver? Which have you not experienced?</li>
<li>Think of feedback you’ve struggled to understand in the past. Which Feedback Animal seems to match how it was delivered?</li>
<li>If you wanted to invent a new card which fitted you perfectly, what would it be?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="" class="inline-block w-8 h-8 mr-3 align-middle" src="Whatsnext/images/image9.png"/>
        Have a <span class="font-bold">conversation with your coach</span> or mentor, sharing your feedback animals. Ask about theirs.
      </p>
<p>

<span class="font-bold">Learn</span> more about effective feedback techniques. There are many great resources including;

        Introduce this activity <span class="font-bold">1:1</span> with people you routinely give feedback to. Especially valuable where it is a new feedback relationship. A good way to start is to share your preferred ways to give and receive feedback. Include the invitation to receive feedback, especially on areas that you want to grow stronger at. Good feedback isn’t hierarchical, it’s a two-way exchange. Remember to introduce the purpose of the activity; to learn more about each other’s feedback approaches to ensure effective feedback conversations, always delivered with good intentions.

<p class="ml-10">
<img alt="" class="inline-block w-8 h-8 mr-3 align-middle" src="Whatsnext/images/image8.png"/>
        The Feedback Animals activity can be a useful tool to kick-off, or reinforce a positive feedback culture in your team. Opportunities where you could use it to start a team conversation include:
      </p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>I’m <span class="font-bold">setting up a new team</span> and I want us to get off to a great start, trust each other and thrive.</li>
<li>New team members have joined my team and we need to do a <span class="font-bold">quick re-set</span> so that no one is left out and there’s good trust and connection.</li>
<li><span class="font-bold">My team is drowning</span>; team members are feeling overwhelmed or in tension and it’s affecting how we work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ml-10">Activities to try, include:</p>
<p class="ml-10"><span class="font-bold">Introduce the Feedback Animals activity with your team</span>. Great for new teams to help them form, or share the activity as part of a team building workshop.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Allow 5-10 mins for each team member to individually complete the activity on their laptops. Take individual screenshots to capture the results.</li>
<li>Take it in turns to share insights, starting with yourself/team leader. Explain when you respond best to receiving feedback.</li>
<li>Discuss as a group what does this mean for the way we give &amp; receive feedback day to day in our roles?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Variation on above - include a <span class="font-bold">‘blank’ card</span> template.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Is there a different feedback animal that best describes you at work?</li>
<li>Complete a card template with its name, characteristics, pros &amp; cons?</li>
<li>Share and explain it to the team.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Understand the different Feedback Animal archetypes better.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Assign different Feedback Animal cards to team members (not the ones that are their preferred archetypes)</li>
<li>Ask them to <span class="font-bold">role play giving &amp; receiving feedback</span> as that archetype. It can be helpful to have a simple feedback scenario prepared for the team <span class="italic">eg: Give feedback to a team member on a small training session they ran that had good content, but lacked hands-on practice.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-bold">Discuss</span>: What did you learn? What do you notice?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-10">
<li>Schedule a Feedback Habits team <span class="font-bold">workshop</span> with <a class="text-blue-700 underline font-bold" href="https://www.unfold-labs.com/what-we-do" target="_blank">Unfold Labs</a></li>
<li><span class="font-bold">Incorporate</span> Feedback Animal cards into your <span class="font-bold">existing learning programs</span> eg Leadership, team skills, onboarding.</li>

<p class="font-bold">Scenario: Missed deadline</p>
<p class="font-bold">Context:</p>
<p>Maria usually pulls together the team summary for the monthly leadership catch-up. Last time, it was late — she’d been waiting on data but didn’t flag it. As a result, the team looked a bit disorganised in front of leadership.</p>
<p class="font-bold">Your Role:</p>
<p>You work alongside Maria. Give her feedback that acknowledges she’s normally solid, explains how the delay affected things, and encourages her to speak up sooner next time.</p>
