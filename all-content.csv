"card","card7","shortText","I dump all my unfiltered thoughts at once without preparation."
"card","card7","cardSummary","I think it's helpful for a person to receive all the feedback in one go, so that they can reflect on what is useful for them. This way I've got all my thoughts on the table. I don't ask if it's a good time. I just open my mouth and whatever comes out, I'll call ""feedback""."
