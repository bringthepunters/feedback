    <section class="mb-10 space-y-6">
      <p>Hey there!</p>
      <p>
        Ever sat down to give someone feedback and felt a little… awkward? Maybe even a little like you're trying to herd a bunch of very opinionated, contradictory cats? Yeah, us too.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the four of us – a bunch of folks who've collectively clocked up almost a <span class="italic">century</span> (whoa, right?!) in the realms of coaching, team leadership, leadership facilitation, and all things people and talent – got together and had a bit of an "aha!" moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were chatting (as you do when you've spent that much time in the people business) and kept circling back to the same thing: <span class="font-bold">good feedback conversations are the unsung heroes of successful teams and organizations.</span> And they’re as rare as hen's teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about it. Sure, strategy is crucial, and having the right resources matters. But without that honest, intentional, and <span class="italic">useful</span> feedback flowing, individuals and teams can get stuck in a rut. They might be good, but that leap to <span class="italic">excel</span>? That often gets missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It got us thinking: <span class="font-bold">what's the roadblock?</span> Why is giving consistent, good-quality feedback so hard? <span class="font-bold">Why do well-intentioned, experienced leaders fail to deliver the feedback that we all know would unlock new levels of growth and performance?</span> And on the flip side, <span class="font-bold">what are those magic ingredients that consistently show up in high-performing teams?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions buzzed around our heads, and that's where the idea for <span class="font-bold">Feedback Animal Cards</span> was born!
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to create something quick, something light, something that could spark a conversation about <span class="italic">your</span> style for giving feedback and what that might mean for members of your team. Think of it as a fun, quick exercise that offers some surprising insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hope is that these cards become more than just a fleeting activity. We envision them as a starting point – a gentle nudge to kick off deeper conversations within your team or with your coach. Conversations that lead to more effective communication, stronger relationships, and ultimately, a more thriving environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We poured a lot of passion and experience into creating these cards, and we genuinely hope you enjoy using them as much as we enjoyed bringing them to life.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700">So, are you ready to discover your inner feedback animal? <span class="font-bold">Let the conversations begin!</span></p>
