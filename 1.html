      <p>Hey there!</p>
      <p>
        Ever sat down to give someone feedback and felt a little… awkward? Maybe even a little like you're trying to herd a bunch of very opinionated, contradictory cats? Yeah, us too.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the four of us – a bunch of folks who've collectively clocked up almost a <span class="italic">century</span> (whoa, right?!) in the realms of coaching, team leadership, leadership facilitation, and all things people and talent – got together and had a bit of an "aha!" moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were chatting (as you do when you've spent that much time in the people business) and kept circling back to the same thing: <span class="font-bold">good feedback conversations are the unsung heroes of successful teams and organizations.</span> And they’re as rare as hen's teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about it. Sure, strategy is crucial, and having the right resources matters. But without that honest, intentional, and <span class="italic">useful</span> feedback flowing, individuals and teams can get stuck in a rut. They might be good, but that leap to <span class="italic">excel</span>? That often gets missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It got us thinking: <span class="font-bold">what's the roadblock?</span> Why is giving consistent, good-quality feedback so hard? <span class="font-bold">Why do well-intentioned, experienced leaders fail to deliver the feedback that we all know would unlock new levels of growth and performance?</span> And on the flip side, <span class="font-bold">what are those magic ingredients that consistently show up in high-performing teams?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions buzzed around our heads, and that's where the idea for <span class="font-bold">Feedback Animal Cards</span> was born!
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to create something quick, something light, something that could spark a conversation about <span class="italic">your</span> style for giving feedback and what that might mean for members of your team. Think of it as a fun, quick exercise that offers some surprising insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hope is that these cards become more than just a fleeting activity. We envision them as a starting point – a gentle nudge to kick off deeper conversations within your team or with your coach. Conversations that lead to more effective communication, stronger relationships, and ultimately, a more thriving environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We poured a lot of passion and experience into creating these cards, and we genuinely hope you enjoy using them as much as we enjoyed bringing them to life.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700">So, are you ready to discover your inner feedback animal? <span class="font-bold">Let the conversations begin!</span></p>

                <p>Hi, I'm Mel. I'm a coach and mentor who guides executives and leaders through the complex decisions that emerge as people, teams, and organisations scale. I love working at the intersection of strategy, culture, and leadership, where results are delivered along with personal growth and lasting change. Drawing from over 4,500 coaching conversations and my global experience leading product development, marketing, and innovation functions, I bring depth and practical wisdom to each client relationship. I'm values-driven and commercially minded, offering straightforward guidance that gets to the heart of what matters. What do clients value most about my work? My ability to ask questions they haven't considered—questions that cut through confusion, connect ideas in new ways and reveal a path forward.</p>

                <p>Hi, I'm Fiona. I coach leaders in tech — especially overthinkers and self-doubters — to build self-awareness, resilience, and collaborative leadership practices to thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments. I have experience building and leading software development organizations across project management, engineering leadership, agile coaching, and operations. I have led teams from 1 to 130 people. The through-line of my approach is to be endlessly curious about how and why things are. <span class="italic">What is driving this behavior? Why is this thing hard to say? What purpose does this have? How can we work with this to get the outcome that we want?</span> I help people untangle limiting beliefs and assumptions to overcome challenges, build collaborative teams, and discover their unique leadership style.</p>
