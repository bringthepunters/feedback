      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-montserrat-alternates text-green-700 mb-4">What personal information is being collected by the Feedback Animals website?</h2>
      <p>In short, none. We don’t collect any information that can identify individuals. You may have noticed that we don’t ask for your name, log-in or email address. Your results disappear when you refresh your screen - remember to take a screen shot if you want to save them.</p>
      <p>We keep a basic activity log that includes things like which cards were selected or moved, along with a session ID and timestamp. We don’t store your IP address. We do store your country, region and city.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">These logs help us understand how people are using the tool so we can make it better — that’s it.</p>
