      <p>These cards are a lighthearted way to think about different styles of giving feedback â€“ don't worry, it's not a psychometric test or personality quiz! We're not scientists; just four people who've given and received a lot of feedback over the years.</p>
      <p>Everyone's different, right? We all have our own style for giving feedback <span class="italic">and</span> preferences for how we like to receive it.</p>
      <p>When we understand more about the ways we give feedback, and even how our teammates do too, it helps us have better feedback conversations. A study by Buckingham, M., & Goodall, A. (2019) in the Harvard Business Review, reported <span class="italic font-bold">teams that consistently give and receive constructive feedback build a culture of psychological safety, which leads to greater performance.</span></p>
      <p><span class="font-bold">The conversation is just getting started.</span> Read on for ideas on how to make the most of what you learn from this quick Feedback Animal Cards activity. We've also shared suggestions on how you can build a stronger feedback culture in your team and some next steps to boost your feedback skills.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>I'm curious to learn more about feedback!</li>
        <li>Giving feedback is increasingly part of my role and frankly it scares me. I want to get better at it.</li>
        <li>I know the way I give feedback will change depending on the situation. I want to get better at being able to change my feedback style when it's needed.</li>
        <li>There are some people that just don't get the feedback I give. It doesn't seem to make any useful difference.</li>
        <li>The last few times I've given feedback to a particular person, it hasn't gone well. I'm scared that if I do it again, I'll permanently scar our relationship.</li>
        <li>There's just something about me. Every time someone wants to give me feedback I feel sick in the stomach and that puts me on the back foot.</li>
        <li>I don't see my boss day to day, but then they insist on giving me feedback about how I do my job and act around others. It's like they're ticking a box, and it's a waste of my time.</li>
        <li>Leaders at my company always talk about how we have a great culture of feedback. We've got loads of forms and processes but I can't remember the last time I heard something useful in a way that showed that they really 'get' me.</li>
